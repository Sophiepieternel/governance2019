Governance in socio-economic pathways and its role for future adaptive capacity

This repository contains the data and the code necessary to replicate the analysis of Andrijevic et al. (2019).
For any comments or questions about the contents of the repository, please address the corresponding author at marina.andrijevic@hu-berlin.de

-The script data_mgmt.R provides the code for importing and wrangling the datasets used for specifying 
the econometric model and the datasets with the existing SSP projections of dependent variables later 
used for projecting governance and the related variables.

-The script projections.R provides the code for replicating the estimates of the econometric models 
(the main specification as well as the sensitivity checks with different specifications), and the 
projections of the governance indicator (or its subcomponents control of corruption and government efficiency; 
and the ND GAIN readiness component).

-The script figures.R provides the code for replicating figures presented in the paper. Minor modifications 
of figures (overlaying and arranging graphs for Figure 1 and Figure 2) for the paper were subsequently done in Adobe Illustrator.
